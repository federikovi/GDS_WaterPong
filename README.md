# UdacityProject2
## Water Pong App
Second Project of the Udacity android scholarship

The goal of this project is to create a Score Keeper app which gives a user the ability to keep track of the score of two different teams playing a game of your choice.
I've chosen the Water Pong counter, itâ€™s a alchool free variant to the classical beer pong.
